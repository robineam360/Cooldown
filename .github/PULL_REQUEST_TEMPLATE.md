Serves:

## Wireframe

<!-- Anything that changes what the user sees — screens, widgets, the pinned
     notification, the Quick Settings tile, chart elements, settings sections —
     needs a wireframe approved BEFORE implementation (CLAUDE.md §2). -->

- [ ] This change alters visible UI, and the wireframe was approved before building
      (link or reference: )
- [ ] No visible UI change (pure logic, parsing, scheduling, tests, docs, or a fix
      restoring an already-approved design)

## What changed

<!-- A few sentences. First use of any tracker ID in this body carries its epic
     name in brackets. -->

## Tests

- [ ] `./gradlew testGithubDebugUnitTest testPlayDebugUnitTest` passes locally
- [ ] New/changed pure logic has unit tests in the existing style

## Credentials check

- [ ] Nothing in this diff or description contains a real token, authorization
      header, or `code_verifier`
