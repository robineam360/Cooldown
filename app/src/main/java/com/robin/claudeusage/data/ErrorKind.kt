/**
 * CCRM-27 (Error Taxonomy): the typed failure kinds, each carrying copy that
 * **names the fix** rather than printing the symptom. Produced where the failure
 * happens (`UsageRepository.doFetch` / `authFailure`), persisted beside
 * `lastStatus` so the notification strip can read it after process death. The
 * raw status string survives as the notice's small detail line —
 * remediation up top, evidence below.
 *
 * [severe] marks the two kinds worth the error colour; the rest render amber —
 * they are transient by nature and the retained last-good snapshot is still on
 * screen next to them.
 *
 * CCRM-57 (Provider Plumbing): the copy is a **function of the provider**, not a
 * fixed string. "Couldn't reach Anthropic" on a ChatGPT account is a lie about
 * which server was unreachable, and the whole point of this taxonomy is that the
 * user can act on what it says. [key] is what gets persisted, so nothing stored
 * changes and an old cached failure re-renders in the right vendor's name.
