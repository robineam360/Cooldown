/**
 * One tracked Claude account.
 *
 * CCRM-6 (Multi-Account) turned this from a two-constant enum into a value type owned by
 * [ProfileRegistry], so the account count is data rather than code. The three fields are
 * deliberately different kinds of thing:
 *
 * - [key] is the **identity**: a stable string that namespaces every store — the credential
 *   and cache prefixes, the history and session-log filenames, the `"profile"` intent extra.
 *   Never reused, never renumbered.
 * - [slot] is the **integer identity** that Android surfaces need: the notification-ID
 *   offset, PendingIntent request codes and alarm request codes. Allocated once from a
 *   persisted monotonic counter and never reused, so a stale surface can never inherit
 *   a *new* account's data. Slots 0 and 1 are pinned to `personal`/`work`: existing
 *   installs have alarms and posted notifications keyed off those exact ints.
 * - [label] is the **user's name for it**, 16 characters, editable and therefore not identity.
 *
 * Equality is the key alone. A [Profile] gets captured in a composition or an intent extra
 * and outlives the label it was built with; if equality included the label then a rename
 * would silently turn `pinnedProfile == p` false and the selected chip would jump. Read a
 * live label through [UsageCache.profileLabel], which resolves by key.
