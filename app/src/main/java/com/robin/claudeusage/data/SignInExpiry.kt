/**
 * What the account card's sign-in expiry line should say (CCRM-16).
 *
 * A native sign-in's token response omits the refresh-family expiry, so the app
 * shows sign-in time + a flat ~30-day guess ([OAuthSignIn.ESTIMATED_FAMILY_MS]).
 * That guess has never been verified against a real expiry, so once renewal has
 * demonstrably died the date must stop rendering as if it were knowledge — a
 * confident "expires around <date>" next to a Needs-re-auth chip is the app
 * contradicting itself. Pure logic so it's testable; the UI maps the result to
 * strings.
 *
 * Keying on [AuthState.REAUTH_NEEDED] alone covers both death signals: a direct
 * 400–403 on refresh sets it immediately, and a failing-renewal streak crossing
 * the stuck threshold escalates to it in `UsageRepository.authFailure`.
