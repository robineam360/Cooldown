/**
 * Pure geometry for the pace-marked horizontal bars (CCRM-43 (Bar Pace Marks),
 * ported from the Mac's CCM-50 [Panel]).
 *
 * Fractions are 0..1 along the bar; multiply by the bar's pixel width at the call
 * site. Kept free of android.graphics like [RingGeometry], so every number here is
 * JVM-testable and the same values serve the in-app Compose bars and the pinned
 * notification's bitmap-drawn bars.
 *
 * Draw order, bottom→top: track · fill · red segment · tick. The tick draws last
 * because it is the only pace signal left when the fill covers it.
 *
 * Two deliberate departures from the handover, from the CCRM-43 wireframe review
 * (rev B, 2026-08-13):
 *  - the segment has **no minimum width** — it starts exactly on the pace line, so
 *    a 3-point overshoot draws a 3-point sliver rather than being inflated to `h`
 *    and dragged back behind the tick;
 *  - the fill→red boundary is a straight vertical edge, not a capsule end. That is
 *    a painter concern ([BarRenderer] clips the red to the fill's shape), but it is
 *    the reason nothing here rounds or pads the segment's start.
