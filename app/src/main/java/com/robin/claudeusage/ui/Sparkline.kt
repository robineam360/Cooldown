 * build one of these from the same inputs: the draw pass from its own `size`, the
 * gesture handler from the size reported by `onSizeChanged`. Same function of the same
 * arguments, so the two can't drift apart.
 *
 * Being free of DrawScope also makes [nearestSample] testable without a Compose UI test,
 * which is why this is public rather than internal — the unit-test source set isn't a

 *    and the chart lines up with when notifications actually fire;
 *  - an "even pace" diagonal from (start, 0%) to (reset, 100%) — above it means
 *    usage is outrunning the window;
 *  - the observed fetches as a filled area + line with a dot on every real
 *    sample, so gaps in polling are visible rather than smoothed away;
 *  - a marker on the latest sample, labelled, so the present is locatable;
 *  - the burn-rate extrapolation as a dashed tail to a hollow, labelled endpoint.
 *
 * One series, so there's no legend: the guides carry their own labels and only
 * the two points worth reading — now and the projection — get value labels.

 * **Touch (CCRM-20).** Tap selects the nearest fetch and pins a callout on it; tapping
 * it again clears. Long-press then drag scrubs along the curve. The scrub is gated
