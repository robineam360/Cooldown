/**
 * Pins the device-code sheet's five states (CCRM-54 (ChatGPT Account) part 2). This
 * module has no Robolectric, so a Compose sheet with five branches can only be
 * checked by eye — which is exactly how the state CCRM-15 (Above-Pace Verification)
 * exists to remember got shipped unobserved. The copy and the state table are pure
 * for that reason; the device pass in Step 5 confirms the layout.
